**Spark Powerhouse Gym** is a **C# WinForms–based desktop application** developed as part of academic coursework. The project simulates a gym management and membership system with a modern, web-style user interface.

The application focuses on **application flow design, role-based access, UI/UX consistency, and event-driven programming**, rather than real-world transactions or live integrations.

The system includes **separate User and Admin modes** and demonstrates how a real-world fitness management platform might function at a conceptual level.
